# Pitch Detector

# Local dev

```
# Clone repo and submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo>

# cd to directory

# optionally, you can do a regular clone, followed by
# git submodule init
# git submodule update

npm install

# Build and start the app
npm run dev
```

With this, the app will be running and you'll get a message giving the
port (e.g, 'Serving! ... Local: http://localhost:5001`).  Browse to that address.
